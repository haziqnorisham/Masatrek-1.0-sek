## DO THIS FIRST BEFORE SUNDAY ##
  1.  Rearrangement of table content in deviceDetails.html broke JavaScript that is
      used for search filter.

  2.   Need to add search filter by department and branch.

## NEED TO BE DONE ON MONDAY ##
  3.  Changes to database structure may break connection between terminal and server.
      Check and verify all connection made to and from the face terminal

  4.  Sync function can only add employee entry to the face terminal. Removal of deleted
      in the Django server does not remove the entry in the face terminal. Need to
      implement this.
 
## DO AFTER COMPLETED TWO ABOVE TASK ##
  5.  Make sure that all function is working correctly and smoothly without any issues.
